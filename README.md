# Pracharya-Client
A platform to answer all your queries reagarding the confusing process of cerfication applications
# Goal to Achieve
For all the Nepali citizens, do you recall the time you went to apply for Driving License or National ID or other similar certifiactions? 
What do you recall?
Was it how you waited in the queue for whole day and were asked to visit the office in different block time and again.
Have you waited in a queue for the department you werent supposed to?
If yes, the reason for this is simply because we didn't know the detailed application process, and congratulations to us, we waited so long waiting while our precious time kepts flowing just to find out we are in the wrong department.
To address such problem and hope it to never occur again, we decided to work on this project, where we hope to create a friendly community of people that share their knowledge and help save other's precious time.
